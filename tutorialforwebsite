## Tutorial and Visualization Demos
The complex, copy-specific nature of the data is designed for thoroughness rather than for quick analysis. In this section, we briefly consider a few way sample applications and uses for the data. We look forward to continuing to explore and hear how people use this data.

### 1. Copy-Specific Information
One strength of END is the it gives researchers the ability to delve deeply into a particular text, volume, or author. For example, if you are interested in Henry Fielding, you can set up a filter to see just his works in our tabular data. From here, it's easier to dig into specific information, such as comparisons in early and later editions of the same work, or between British and American editions.

The following shows how to set up a filter in two variables. (We use Excel here, but this will also work in Google Sheets, etc.)

### 2. Comparative Information
Pivot tables, which can be created quickly in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, allow you to compare multiple variables. Please note that depending on the field and your question, the data may need to be cleaned and organized first (we recommend <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a>). 

Here, we imagine that the scholar is interested in seeing details of how the database was created, recorded in our 999 fields. 

First, we highlight the information that interests us, and create the pivot table. 

![Show how to create a pivot table. Highlight columns, right click, "Insert pivot table," add new sheet.](https://github.com/earlynovels/end-dataset/blob/master/Tutorial%20Images/END%20Create%20Pivot.gif "Pivot Table Create Demo")

Next, we add the data to different fields to compare information, and then we create a chart. 

![Show how to go from pivot table to chart. Pick rows and values, then click in table, Insert -> chart. (Pie chart in demo.)](https://github.com/earlynovels/end-dataset/blob/master/Tutorial%20Images/END%20Pivot%20to%20Chart.gif "Pivot Table to Chart Demo")

With the pivot table, we're able to create a couple of different types of visuals by manipulating the variables in different columns. 

For example, we examine dates vs. schools (drag 999$b to "rows" and 999$c to "columns" and "values") to create the following visual on the institutional affiliation of our catalogers. In this, you can see that the END project has recently expanded to a broader set of institutions.

<br>


Next, we examined catalogers vs. schools (999$c to "rows" and "values") to show how many catalog records we have from each of our different institutions. NYU is new to the project, but has already added a significant number of records, for example.

<br>


Finally, we chart our individual catalogers, who all sign by initial, to see which people are the most frequent contributers to the database (999$d to "rows" and "values"). The main takeaway: this database is a deeply collaborative effort.

Enjoy exploring!
